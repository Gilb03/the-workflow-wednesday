        <p>There is no commitment necessary, Friday should flow, and that’s just how it goes. We are located downtown, on the riverfront in close proximity to popular local bars and night clubs. Smale Park provides a great view and a short bridge walk over to Covington where there are also local breweries and bars.  </p>
